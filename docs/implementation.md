# Integration architecture

## Layer Dependency Rules

The monorepo owns infrastructure orchestration and immutable Git submodule pins. Plugin domain/application/platform code remains in each authoritative repository. This change introduces no application imports or runtime adapters.

## Forbidden Domain Annotations

forbidden: [org.springframework.*, jakarta.persistence.*, javax.persistence.*, com.fasterxml.jackson.*, io.micronaut.*, lombok.*]

## EnthusiaSignature

`plugins/enthusia-signature` references `FainNeito/ItemSignature`. Its independent Maven build targets Java 21 and produces `target/EnthusiaSignature-1.3.0.jar`; do not register it as a Gradle composite build. Existing network Java 25 builders also support its Java 21 bytecode. The optional native spear listener is capability-gated by the plugin.

Unix/Windows helpers and CI run its complete verification separately from Maven compile dependencies that skip tests. Upstream watch follows its main branch. No item data, defaults, permissions, other submodule pins, or deployment actions change.
